This error typically occurs when you're using an older version of Expo CLI or have conflicting dependencies.  It might manifest as a seemingly random crash during development or build processes, often without clear error messages in the terminal.  The underlying issue is usually related to incorrect or outdated native modules, which Expo relies heavily upon to interface with device capabilities.
