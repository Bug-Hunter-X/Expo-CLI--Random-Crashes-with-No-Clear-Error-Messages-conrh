# Expo CLI: Random Crashes - Debugging Guide

This repository documents a subtle bug in Expo CLI that leads to seemingly random crashes during development or build processes. The issue is characterized by a lack of clear error messages, making it difficult to diagnose. The root cause often involves outdated or conflicting native modules.

## Steps to Reproduce

Reproducing this bug is challenging due to its random nature. It often manifests after a series of seemingly unrelated actions, like installing new packages or updating Expo CLI.

## Solution

The most effective solution is a combination of dependency management and ensuring that the Expo CLI and its native modules are up-to-date.

1. **Update Expo CLI:**  Use `npm install -g expo-cli` (or `yarn global add expo-cli`) to ensure you're on the latest version.
2. **Clean your project:** Delete your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) file. Reinstall your dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. **Check for conflicting dependencies:** Carefully review your `package.json` for potential conflicts.  Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to examine the dependency tree and identify any problematic relationships.
4. **Update native modules (advanced):** In more complex cases, you may need to explicitly update Expo's underlying native modules. This is less common but could resolve the issue.
5. **Check for third-party library conflicts:** Sometimes, third-party libraries you have integrated could be the source of the conflict. Try to temporarily remove them and observe if your Expo project operates correctly without them.
